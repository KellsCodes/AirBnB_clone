# Airbnb Console Clone Project

![Screenshot](hbnb.png)

This project is the first step towards building a full web application: the AirBnB clone. 
The console or command interpreter create the data model and allows create, update, destroy, store and persist objects to a file (JSON file). 
This console will be a tool to validate this storage engine.

## The Command interpreter

Building this command interpreter will allow the user/developer to interact with this program using commands in the form of text lines.
This helps in our case, to be able to manage the objects of our project:
* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object
